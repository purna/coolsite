<h1 class="title">Simple LEGO Game</h1>
    <h1 class="subt">Introduction</h1>
    <div class="intr"><p class="into">This is a slightly more fun though challenging application of the languages we have learnt before. Your task is to create a simple goal shooting game that uses the structure of HTML, the design of CSS and the animation of JavaScript.<br>This is spanned over two lessons though it can be made more complicated (and more animated) in your own time.</p></div>

   <h1 class="subt">Aim</h1>

    <div class="intr">
        <p class="into">The main aim of this game is to shoot a ball to either the left or right of a goal. If the ball hits the target you are awarded a point. If it hits the goalie, you do not gain a point. You will have ten attempts to get the highest score you can. Alongside the game, there will also be a small section of formatted text on the right hand side, which will include the rules of the game.</p>
