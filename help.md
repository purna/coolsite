    <h1>Simple LEGO Game Help</h1>
    <h3 >Introduction</h3>
    <p >This is a slightly more fun though challenging <b>application</b> of the languages we have <i>learnt</i> before. Your task is to create a simple goal shooting game that uses the structure of HTML, the design of CSS and the animation of JavaScript.<br>This is spanned over two lessons though it can be made more complicated (and more animated) in your own time.</p>

   <h3 >Aim</h3>
   <p>The main aim of this game is to <i><b>shoot a ball</b></i> to either the left or right of a goal. If the ball hits the target you are awarded a point. If it hits the goalie, you do not gain a point. You will have ten attempts to get the highest score you can. Alongside the game, there will also be a small section of formatted text on the right hand side, which will include the rules of the game.</p>
